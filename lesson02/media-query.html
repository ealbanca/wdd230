            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son
                of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
                yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you,
                it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of
                the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they
                cannot fall.</p>
